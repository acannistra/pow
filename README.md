# POW!
*In active development*. 

This is a small hobby project to create an in-home display to communicate
whether a specified region of interest has received a considerable amount of snowfall (**POW**) within the recent time.

It's comprised of Raspberry Pi Zero hardware running a server on a local network. The server is responsible for periodically checking for snowfall reports, illumating the display accordingly via a Rpi-controlled relay, and allowing a user on the network to change the location being tracked.
